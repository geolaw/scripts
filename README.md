# scripts

Lots of Misc shell scripts - some go back literally close to 25 years :)

cbr2cbz.nemo_action	- Add cbr2cbz.sh to the nemo file manager right click context. Store in .local/share/nemo/actions/ - modify with path to cbr2cbz.sh script

cbr2cbz.sh	- convert from a comic book rar archive to a comic book zip archive - suitable for ereaders like my wife's nook

cpacct.pl	- package and copy a cpanel account

doSed	- run sed on a file or group of files, text/exe mode

hb_encode	Encode a file using HandBrakeCLI


image_stacker.sh -- my attempt at trying to create a long exposure photo by
capturing X number of frames out of a video clip.  Still a work in progress.
